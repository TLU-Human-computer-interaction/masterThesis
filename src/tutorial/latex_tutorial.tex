\subsection{Table of contents}
For custom tables tocloft package might be useful.
\subsection{General}~\label{sec:Mysec}
This is a sample introduction section.
This is the second linne in the section.
% \Large this will make all text after this large
{\Large this will make only the text inside the brakets large}
\textit{ this will make only the text inside the brakets italic}
\textbf{ this will make only the text inside the brakets bold}
\underline{this will make only the text inside the brakets underliend} \\
\textbf{\textit{\underline{ this will make only the text inside the brakets cold italic and underlined }}}
% this alters the intentation of the entire document by default there is new lines in intented
% \setlength{\parindent}{1cm}

\uline{Ulem pacage example. This is better for underline than regular underline, because it can break lines}

\uuline{and has more options}

\uwave{and has more options}



And this is the Third line. \\
This is how you change the line.

\section{Motivation}
The goal of this little document is to understand how to use latex and test it out a bit before starting to write my master thesis.
