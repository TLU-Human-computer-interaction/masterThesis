\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Limitations of the study}

The tool that was used was chosen with the limitation of our current tooling. There are plenty of other options out there. Some free some paid and some of them might be more effective than the one we decided to use.

We had limited time. The tool was in use for a bit more than 5 months. It will continue to be used and it would be interesting to see how well it performs long term.

Manual accessibility audit might have not had enough highly qualified accessibility experts on the team.

\subsection{Future research}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Testing storybook 7 and its test runner.
	\item Components that only show a button-play function + test-runner? Would it work?
	\item Adding accessibility tests as a part of library setup - would that have a bigger impact
\end{enumerate}
