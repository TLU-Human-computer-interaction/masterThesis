  abstract     = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated that creation of online health insurance websites to ease the complex process of shopping for and enrolling into coverage. Ensuring that these sites are not only available but also meet digital accessibility standards is important so that individuals with disabilities are able to access healthcare services and efficiently obtain insurance coverage. We evaluated each of the marketplace sites in 2020 to assess whether they are digitally accessible. We employed a custom audit tool based on a subset of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 AA and used content analysis to compare the site's accessibility statements with best practices. Nearly all of the ACA marketplace websites have significant room to improve their digital accessibility. Notable technical problem areas include lack of text equivalents for images, difficult site navigation, and lack of optimization for mobile use, particularly on those pages that provide instructions on how to get in-person help. Given that access to health insurance is a primary predictor of access to health care â€“ sites must be easy to use and accessible to all individuals regardless of ability. Barriers to online enrollment, such as those identified in this work, may exacerbate disparities in quality of care, treatment continuity and affordability for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. Entities providing health-related online information \& engagement should be aware of actionable opportunities to improve digital accessibility to optimize the enrollment process for both maintaining coverage and assisting those that remain uninsured.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of e-services in the past two decades, the concept of web accessibility has been given attention to ensure that every individual can benefit from these services without any barriers. Web accessibility is considered one of the main factors that should be taken into consideration while developing webpages. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) have been developed to guide web developers to ensure that web contents are accessible for all users, especially disabled users. Many automatic tools have been developed to check the compliance of websites with accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.0 and to help web developers and content creators with designing webpages without barriers for disabled people. Despite the popularity of accessibility evaluation tools in practice, there is no systematic way to compare the performance of web accessibility evaluators. This paper first presents two novel frameworks. The first one is proposed to compare the performance of web accessibility evaluation tools in detecting web accessibility issues based on WCAG 2.0. The second framework is utilized to evaluate webpages in meeting these guidelines. Six homepages of Saudi universities were chosen as case studies to substantiate the concept of the proposed frameworks. Furthermore, two popular web accessibility evaluators, Wave and SiteImprove, are selected to compare their performance. The outcomes of studies conducted using the first proposed framework showed that SiteImprove outperformed WAVE. According to the outcomes of the studies conducted, we can conclude that web administrators would benefit from the first framework in selecting an appropriate tool based on its performance to evaluate their websites based on accessibility criteria and guidelines. Moreover, the findings of the studies conducted using the second proposed framework showed that the homepage of Taibah University is more accessible than the homepages of other Saudi universities. Based on the findings of this study, the second framework can be used by web administrators and developers to measure the accessibility of their websites. This paper also discusses the most common accessibility issues reported by WAVE and SiteImprove.},

This paper compares a set of WCAG tools and their results in terms of ease of comprehension and implementation by web developers. The paper highlights accessibility issues that cannot be captured only through conformance to WCAG tools and propose additional methods to evaluate accessibility through an Inclusive User Model. We initially selected ten WCAG tools from W3 website and used a set of these tools on the landing pages of BBC and WHO websites. We compared their outcome in terms of commonality, differences, amount of details and usability. Finally, we briefly introduced the Inclusive User Model and demonstrated how simulation of user interaction can capture usability and accessibility issues that are not detected through WCAG analysis. The paper concludes with a proposal on a Common User Profile format that can be used to compare and contrast accessibility systems and services},

  abstract = {The lack of accessibility on websites can result in people with disabilities not accessing information online. Therefore, this research aims to create a process model for continuous web accessibility testing by adapting and customizing three methodologies: Deming cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act), Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM), and Total Quality Management. The process model is composed of four phases. The first phase (Plan) allows defining the accessibility problem, its importance, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) against which it will be evaluated. In addition, determine the current situation of the websites, the potential causes of accessibility problems, classify the success criteria by principles, guidelines, and levels of conformity, to elaborate the solution plan and the action plan. The second phase (Do) allows the execution of the action plan to correct the accessibility problems. In this phase, we should perform continuous t},

  abstract     = {The use of online tools is a common practice for evaluating the accessibility of a website, identifying problems, and providing useful feedback on how to fix detected issues. For ease of accessibility validation, many tools have been developed and implemented successfully over the years. Yet, the results of these tools show differences in terms of coverage, correctness, and reporting-related issues. In this study, we compared online accessibility evaluation tools to understand to what extent they differ in detecting accessibility problems in websites. A total of 41 government websites of different countries were tested for violations of accessibility guidelines using six evaluation tools. We observed that each tool generated different evaluation data for the same websites. As some of the tools are complementary to each other, meaning the highest coverage and completeness can be possible with the right combination of evaluation tools. Therefore, we suggest different tools should be utilized to provide consistency and obtain reliable data from online evaluation tools, thereby improving tool effectiveness.},

The tools are Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, Jamboard, and Poll Everywhere. First, we provide an overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and digital accessibility definitions, descriptions of screen reading assistive technology, and the current use of tech tools in information literacy instruction for student engagement. Second, we examine accessibility testing assessments of the five tech tools selected for this paper. Our data show that the tools had severe, significant, and minor levels of digital accessibility problems, and while there were some shared issues, most problems were unique to the individual tools. We explore the implications of tech tools' unique environments as well as the importance of best practices and shared vocabularies. We also argue that digital accessibility benefits all users. Finally, we provide recommendations for teaching librarians to collaborate with campus offices to assess and advance the use of accessible tech tools in information literacy instruction, thereby enhancing an equitable learning environment for all students.},
