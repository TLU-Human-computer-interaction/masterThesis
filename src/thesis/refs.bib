  abstract     = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated that creation of online health insurance websites to ease the complex process of shopping for and enrolling into coverage. Ensuring that these sites are not only available but also meet digital accessibility standards is important so that individuals with disabilities are able to access healthcare services and efficiently obtain insurance coverage. We evaluated each of the marketplace sites in 2020 to assess whether they are digitally accessible. We employed a custom audit tool based on a subset of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 AA and used content analysis to compare the site's accessibility statements with best practices. Nearly all of the ACA marketplace websites have significant room to improve their digital accessibility. Notable technical problem areas include lack of text equivalents for images, difficult site navigation, and lack of optimization for mobile use, particularly on those pages that provide instructions on how to get in-person help. Given that access to health insurance is a primary predictor of access to health care – sites must be easy to use and accessible to all individuals regardless of ability. Barriers to online enrollment, such as those identified in this work, may exacerbate disparities in quality of care, treatment continuity and affordability for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. Entities providing health-related online information \& engagement should be aware of actionable opportunities to improve digital accessibility to optimize the enrollment process for both maintaining coverage and assisting those that remain uninsured.},

The tools are Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, Jamboard, and Poll Everywhere. First, we provide an overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and digital accessibility definitions, descriptions of screen reading assistive technology, and the current use of tech tools in information literacy instruction for student engagement. Second, we examine accessibility testing assessments of the five tech tools selected for this paper. Our data show that the tools had severe, significant, and minor levels of digital accessibility problems, and while there were some shared issues, most problems were unique to the individual tools. We explore the implications of tech tools' unique environments as well as the importance of best practices and shared vocabularies. We also argue that digital accessibility benefits all users. Finally, we provide recommendations for teaching librarians to collaborate with campus offices to assess and advance the use of accessible tech tools in information literacy instruction, thereby enhancing an equitable learning environment for all students.},

For ease of accessibility validation, many tools have been developed and implemented successfully over the years. Yet, the results of these tools show differences in terms of coverage, correctness, and reporting-related issues. In this study, we compared online accessibility evaluation tools to understand to what extent they differ in detecting accessibility problems in websites. A total of 41 government websites of different countries were tested for violations of accessibility guidelines using six evaluation tools. We observed that each tool generated different evaluation data for the same websites. As some of the tools are complementary to each other, meaning the highest coverage and completeness can be possible with the right combination of evaluation tools. Therefore, we suggest different tools should be utilized to provide consistency and obtain reliable data from online evaluation tools, thereby improving tool effectiveness.},
