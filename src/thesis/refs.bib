  abstract     = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated that creation of online health insurance websites to ease the complex process of shopping for and enrolling into coverage. Ensuring that these sites are not only available but also meet digital accessibility standards is important so that individuals with disabilities are able to access healthcare services and efficiently obtain insurance coverage. We evaluated each of the marketplace sites in 2020 to assess whether they are digitally accessible. We employed a custom audit tool based on a subset of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 AA and used content analysis to compare the site's accessibility statements with best practices. Nearly all of the ACA marketplace websites have significant room to improve their digital accessibility. Notable technical problem areas include lack of text equivalents for images, difficult site navigation, and lack of optimization for mobile use, particularly on those pages that provide instructions on how to get in-person help. Given that access to health insurance is a primary predictor of access to health care â€“ sites must be easy to use and accessible to all individuals regardless of ability. Barriers to online enrollment, such as those identified in this work, may exacerbate disparities in quality of care, treatment continuity and affordability for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. Entities providing health-related online information \& engagement should be aware of actionable opportunities to improve digital accessibility to optimize the enrollment process for both maintaining coverage and assisting those that remain uninsured.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of e-services in the past two decades, the concept of web accessibility has been given attention to ensure that every individual can benefit from these services without any barriers. Web accessibility is considered one of the main factors that should be taken into consideration while developing webpages. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) have been developed to guide web developers to ensure that web contents are accessible for all users, especially disabled users. Many automatic tools have been developed to check the compliance of websites with accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.0 and to help web developers and content creators with designing webpages without barriers for disabled people. Despite the popularity of accessibility evaluation tools in practice, there is no systematic way to compare the performance of web accessibility evaluators. This paper first presents two novel frameworks. The first one is proposed to compare the performance of web accessibility evaluation tools in detecting web accessibility issues based on WCAG 2.0. The second framework is utilized to evaluate webpages in meeting these guidelines. Six homepages of Saudi universities were chosen as case studies to substantiate the concept of the proposed frameworks. Furthermore, two popular web accessibility evaluators, Wave and SiteImprove, are selected to compare their performance. The outcomes of studies conducted using the first proposed framework showed that SiteImprove outperformed WAVE. According to the outcomes of the studies conducted, we can conclude that web administrators would benefit from the first framework in selecting an appropriate tool based on its performance to evaluate their websites based on accessibility criteria and guidelines. Moreover, the findings of the studies conducted using the second proposed framework showed that the homepage of Taibah University is more accessible than the homepages of other Saudi universities. Based on the findings of this study, the second framework can be used by web administrators and developers to measure the accessibility of their websites. This paper also discusses the most common accessibility issues reported by WAVE and SiteImprove.},

We initially selected ten WCAG tools from W3 website and used a set of these tools on the landing pages of BBC and WHO websites. We compared their outcome in terms of commonality, differences, amount of details and usability. Finally, we briefly introduced the Inclusive User Model and demonstrated how simulation of user interaction can capture usability and accessibility issues that are not detected through WCAG analysis. The paper concludes with a proposal on a Common User Profile format that can be used to compare and contrast accessibility systems and services},

The process model is composed of four phases. The first phase (Plan) allows defining the accessibility problem, its importance, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) against which it will be evaluated. In addition, determine the current situation of the websites, the potential causes of accessibility problems, classify the success criteria by principles, guidelines, and levels of conformity, to elaborate the solution plan and the action plan.

  abstract     = {The use of online tools is a common practice for evaluating the accessibility of a website, identifying problems, and providing useful feedback on how to fix detected issues. For ease of accessibility validation, many tools have been developed and implemented successfully over the years. Yet, the results of these tools show differences in terms of coverage, correctness, and reporting-related issues. In this study, we compared online accessibility evaluation tools to understand to what extent they differ in detecting accessibility problems in websites. A total of 41 government websites of different countries were tested for violations of accessibility guidelines using six evaluation tools. We observed that each tool generated different evaluation data for the same websites. As some of the tools are complementary to each other, meaning the highest coverage and completeness can be possible with the right combination of evaluation tools. Therefore, we suggest different tools should be utilized to provide consistency and obtain reliable data from online evaluation tools, thereby improving tool effectiveness.},

The tools are Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, Jamboard, and Poll Everywhere. First, we provide an overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and digital accessibility definitions, descriptions of screen reading assistive technology, and the current use of tech tools in information literacy instruction for student engagement. Second, we examine accessibility testing assessments of the five tech tools selected for this paper. Our data show that the tools had severe, significant, and minor levels of digital accessibility problems, and while there were some shared issues, most problems were unique to the individual tools. We explore the implications of tech tools' unique environments as well as the importance of best practices and shared vocabularies. We also argue that digital accessibility benefits all users. Finally, we provide recommendations for teaching librarians to collaborate with campus offices to assess and advance the use of accessible tech tools in information literacy instruction, thereby enhancing an equitable learning environment for all students.},

Web accessibility evaluation methods are needed to validate the accessibility of web pages. However, the role of subjectivity and of expertise in such methods is unknown and has not previously been studied. This article investigates the effect of expertise in web accessibility evaluation methods by conducting a Barrier Walkthrough (BW) study with 19 expert and 57 nonexpert judges. The BW method is an evaluation method that can be used to manually assess the accessibility of web pages for different user groups such as motor impaired, low vision, blind, and mobile users. Our results show that expertise matters, and even though the effect of expertise varies depending on the metric used to measure quality, the level of expertise is an important factor in the quality of accessibility evaluation of web pages. In brief, when pages are evaluated with nonexperts, we observe},

However, little is known to date about their relative strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, what happened for usability evaluation methods is likely to repeat for accessibility: that there is uncertainty about not only pros and cons of methods, but also about criteria to be used to compare them and metrics to measure these criteria. After a quick review and description of methods, the paper illustrates a comparative test of two web accessibility evaluation methods: conformance testing and barrier walkthrough. The comparison aims at determining merits of barrier walkthrough, using conformance testing as a control condition. A comparison framework is outlined, followed by the description of a laboratory experiment with 12 subjects (novice accessibility evaluators), and its results. Significant differences were found in terms of correctness, one of the several metrics used to compare the methods. Reliability also appears to be different.},

Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
                  
                  WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.
                  
                  WCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [WCAG20], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.}

Here we study the adaptation and evolution of code writing and submission, issue and pull request closing, and testing practices as Travis CI is adopted by hundreds of established projects on GitHub. To help essentialize the quantitative results, we also survey a sample of GITHUB developers about their experiences with adopting Travis CI. Our findings suggest a more nuanced picture of how GitHub teams are adapting to, and benefiting from, continuous integration technology than suggested by prior work.},

Each evaluation conducted an accessibility review using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA. In addition, experts highlighted potential issues which were not covered by these guidelines but could be potential issues encountered by people with disabilities. The study depicts those issues that were raised by experts during those audits but were not covered by the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Finally, the study provides additional knowledge into potential problems as identified by experts and recommends techniques that developers and designers can use to create more accessible websites.},

To fill this gap, we introduce the Enterprise Accessibility Conformance Ontology, which extends previous ontologies to include the relevant concepts. We demonstrate the use of the ontology to provide a unifying model of the accessibility domain that contributed to a 22 performance improvement for a question-answering accessibility conformance chatbot.},

                 (Europe 2020), which the European Commission uses as a framework
                 to monitor the situation each year. To this end, Eurostat has
                 created quantitative indicators to monitor progress towards the
                 targets, notably in the areas of employment, poverty and social
                 exclusion and education. Consequently, it is important to assess
                 the situation of persons with disabilities in relation to the
                 Europe 2020 headline targets on employment, poverty and
                 education, using EU comparative data. In this report, this set of
                 indicators has been extended to include health issues. The
                 quantitative indicators should identify any gap between persons
                 with and without disabilities and reveal any convergence or
                 divergence in relation to the targets. An increasing gap or
                 divergence will signal the need for new initiatives. Under the
                 Europe 2020 strategy, the joint assessment framework (JAF) plays
                 an important role in the development of quantitative indicators.
                 In this respect, the work of the committees involved (the
                 Employment, Social Protection, Health and Education Committees)
                 provides early signals on indicators for monitoring and analysis.
                 At this end, we collect and analyse data to understand and
                 illustrate the situation of people with disabilities in Europe.
                 This statistical analysis could be used as an instrument to
                 monitor the effectiveness of national and European policies,
                 assess the situation of persons with and without disabilities and
                 identify areas where the gap between persons with and without
                 disabilities is decreasing (or increasing).}

  abstract  = {Evaluating Web sites for accessibility remains an effort intensive process. Potentially, evaluation tools can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of Web accessibility evaluations but the currently available tool market only provides little or no consistency in the reliability and performance amongst these tools. In fact, in some cases evaluation tools may be confusing or misleading to users with little or no experience in Web accessibility. This paper will highlight how the utilization of Semantic Web technologies in evaluation tools can facilitate the exchange of evaluation data between tools and hence provide new approaches to support designers, content authors, programmers, quality assurance reviewers, project managers, or other users in accomplishing their respective tasks during the development and maintenance of accessible Web sites. Furthermore, this paper will also highlight some additional usages of Semantic Web enabled Web accessibility evaluation tools beyond the scope of evaluation processes.},

The four tools were: Axe-core/cli, IBM Equal Access NPM Accessibility Checker (Accessibility Checker), Pa11y-ci, and the A11y Machine. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Gwetâ€™s alpha coefficient 2 (AC2), and the results indicate very poor reliability between tools.},
