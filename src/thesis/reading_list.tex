\subsection*{\citep{Vigo2013}}
What could be the harm in relying on automated testing? This research look at number of available automated evaluation tools and compares their output to that of a team of experts in regard to the coverage, completeness and correctness. Results show that relying on tools alone is not recommended, because even if the right tool is used only 6 out of 10 violations would be caught. Tools seem to be more effective on very inaccessible sites.
