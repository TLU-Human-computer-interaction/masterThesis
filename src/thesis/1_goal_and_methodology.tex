\section{Research goal and methodology}
\subsection{Research goal}

Linters and tests are used in software development to ensure that all newly added code follows the quality and best practice standards that the company or developer has defined and that these changes don't break anything. A similar quality gate could be set up for ensuring conformance with accessibility standards. This would act as a gatekeeper to ensure that if there are any detectable problems in the added code then it can not be deployed until these have been fixed.

In this thesis, I intend to test if automated accessibility tests can help improve overall accessibility and awareness about it. Most testing tools also provide links and instructions about the issue that was detected. I think this could help improve the knowledge of the developers who use these tools. They can learn about common accessibility problems and how to fix them.

Many companies have design systems to help maintain consistency both in what the end users experience and how code is written. This seems like a good place to start with establishing a basic level of accessibility. Making changes there would have the biggest impact. Most accessibility checkers are intended to be used for the whole page or website. I want to run these tests on the individual components in a component library.

There are limitations to testing isolated components, but how I see it is similar to unit tests and end-to-end tests in software development. Unit tests are used to ensure that a small specific part of the code - a unit works as intended. End-to-end tests are run when all these parts are combined to make up the end product and they should check if all these small parts also work well in combination with each other. These tests are imitating what would happen when end users are using the product.

I see the accessibility tests being run on isolated components as being similar to unit tests - each one making sure that that particular element has no issues. Then when the components are used to make up a whole page there should already be fewer issues that need to be dealt with and the next steps could be taken to ensure a high level of accessibility.

% Many studies have been done to compare different accessibility testing tools \citep{Alsaeedi2020, Ismailova2022, Sane2021, Vigo2013, RybinKoob2022, Duran2017}. I will take a look at the results of these studies and truly out enough tools on my own to find one that would be usable for my purposes, but I am not intending to compare them methodically as a part of this work. I will rely on the comparisons that have been made by others in the past.

I intend to try out an automated accessibility tool in my workplace on our React component library - Convention UI React (CUI). This will probably pose some limitations on the tool I can use. The selected tool should work with our current tooling and not disrupt the current development flow.

\subsection{Research questions}

	\begin{RQlist}
		\item How good is the knowledge about accessibility standards, tools and best practices in the company currently?
		\item What kind of errors can be caught by running automated accessibility tests on a component library?
		\item To what extent can integrating automated testing into a component library's development pipeline help improve its compliance with WCAG standards?
		% This might be the most difficult question to answer. There is not enough time to do another manual audit, but I can generate a new automatic report. What can I read into that? If the state is better now is it because of the automated accessibility tool integration or because we also did a manual audit? Maybe I can get some insights from the end questionnaire + reaching out to some devs who have used these tools during that period. Is this a one-time fix and if now then what evidence do I have that it would have a wider impact?
		\item What are the biggest problems of integrating automated accessibility testing into a component libraries' development workflow?

\begin{list}{-}{}
	\item Literature review
	\item Survey
	\item Case study
	\item Statistical analysis of survey and case study results
	\item User-centered research? (this was suggested when I presented my proposal. Does it make sense now?)

\subsubsection{Literature review}

A literature review is a critical analysis of existing research and scholarly literature on a particular topic. It involves systematically reviewing, evaluating, and synthesizing existing knowledge and research findings in a specific field to identify the gaps in the current knowledge and identify avenues for further research. \todo{find citation}

% A literature review typically involves the following steps:

% Defining the research question or topic: The first step is to clearly define the research question or topic that you want to explore.

In my work literature review was needed to understand the current landscape of automated accessibility testing. These kinds of tools have been available for a long time and I wanted to understand how much we already know about their strengths and weaknesses. Have they been tested in real-world situations and what are the results? What is the difference between these tools? Have some been proven to be better than others?


% Identifying relevant literature: The next step is to identify relevant literature that relates to the research question or topic. This involves searching electronic databases, academic journals, books, and other resources for articles, studies, and research papers.

I will look through any research papers on the subject of automated accessibility testing and also any relevant articles or blog posts. Things change fast in software development and I am not expecting to find the most up-to-date information from scientific publications. That's why I think it is also necessary to include resources that have been published only on reputable sites.

% Evaluating the literature: Once the relevant literature has been identified, it is important to critically evaluate it to determine the quality, relevance, and reliability of the sources. This includes assessing the research methods, findings, and conclusions of each study.

% Synthesizing the literature: The final step involves synthesizing the findings of the literature review to draw conclusions and identify the gaps in the existing knowledge. This involves identifying common themes and patterns in the literature, as well as areas where more research is needed.

% Overall, a literature review is an important part of the research process that helps to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge and research findings in a specific field. It helps to identify gaps in the current knowledge and provides a foundation for further research.


\subsubsection{Case study}

A case study is an in-depth analysis of a bounded system \citep{Range2023}. It involves multiple forms of data collection like observations, interviews, documents, reports and analysis. The case can be a specific individual, group, community, business, organization, event or phenomenon. It can be chosen because of its uniqueness or typicality. The goal of using case study methodology is to investigate something that is contemporary in its real-life context.

The results of a single case study might be very subjective to that particular case and to the biased opinions of the researcher and can't always be generalized and applied to other similar situations \citep{Range2023}. The richness of detail they provide makes them fascinating and often they end with lessons learned or implications that can be applied to other similar cases. It is a good method for exploratory or critical and unusual cases.

I conducted an organizational case study that focused on the process of evaluating and improving the accessibility of CRM (customer relationship management) tool called Pipedrive. In the scope of this study, I added an automated accessibility evaluation tool in our component library and conducted a manual accessibility evaluation of the same library together with 3 designers working in the company.

Before implementing the new tool I sent out a questionnaire to understand the knowledge about and approaches towards the subject of web accessibility in the company among people who are most likely to be doing work related to it. At the end of my research, I sent out another questionnaire with a focus on gaining information from people in the organization who use the tool that I added during that period. I wanted to know if it was helpful and if they had any issues using it and what other opinions they might have about it. The goal of both of these was to get more detailed information about the real user's experience.

I organized the data collected from automated and manual testing to make it comparable. I used statistical analysis to gain valuable insight into how well these two methods work and how they might differ from one another.
